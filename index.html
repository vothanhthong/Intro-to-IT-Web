              After the discussion , the team come to the decision of a outfit
              costumize website that enables users to custom their own clothes.
              The website would include different types of clothes (or at least
              the most popular clothes pieces nowadays) with the customization
              including colors, shapes, small pieces of accessories, ... As the
              website’s purpose is to offer users chances to customize their own
              clothes according to their hobbies, it would also require a design
              department in order to create a successful website. This
              appearance is very important with this kind of website. The reason
              we think this website is interesting is that until now, there are
              still very few websites that enable users to customize their own
              clothes. This website give user opportunity to put their own style
              into the clothes. Everybody likes to own at least one piece of
              clothes that is unique and show their characteristics, their
              styles which no one can buy or find. The website would include a
              task bar with a large screen that presents the clothes design. The
              task bar would be placed on top of the website with different
              types of clothes such as pants, t-shirts, shirts, sweaters, ...
            </p>
            <p>
              As the users access the website, the first step is to choose what
              type of clothes they want to customize. As they click on the kind
              of clothes, the most basic image of that clothes would be
              presented on the customizing screen. At the bottom of the screen,
              at the same time, there will be a customizing bar displayed which
              might include colors for different parts of the clothes, shape,
              accessories and some simple images that users can choose to put on
              the clothes. The user can also insert the pictures from their
              devices to put on the clothes as their want according to their own
              style. We offers two main printing methods, screen printing and
              direct-to-garment (or digital) printing. Screen printing is the
              art of applying layers directly to a t-shirt, and
              direct-to-garment printing is handled by a garment printer that
              carefully applies ink to shirts. We promise to always use the best
              print method for your order’s unique needs.
            </p>
            <p>
              After finishing customizing their clothes, users can have a look
              at their finished product and decide to go to the payment process
              or not. If they have not yet satisfied with the products
              customized, users can always go back to the previous steps and
              start customizing their products again. If they have satisfied
              with the product and choose to pay for the clothes they make,
              customers can carry out the payment step and choose to take the
              product at the store or to have their products shipped. Other
              details needed to be included on the website probably the brand’s
              name (an unique name for the brand so that the customers can
              introduce to their friends if they want), contact details,
              including telephone number, email, address so that users can
              contact if they have any problems or questions.
            </p>
            <p>
              Also, there will be a report and contribution part for customers
              to send their reviews and comments to improve the experience for
              the users. There should also be a reviews part where customers can
              access and read reviews from other customers about the products as
              for online shopping, it is always very important to refer to
              comments and reviews before deciding to purchase something,
              especially clothes (customers always consider materials and the
              shape of There would be some foreseeable risk on the building
              stage of the project and the outcome as well. By hosting on
              GitHub, there will be no maintaining fee for the website. As the
              team have not had much experience, the coding member of the team
              had to learn new coding language to build the web. Furthermore,
              about the site responsive, we have to work on the desktop
              stylesheet and then the mobile styling later. At this stage, it
              would be difficult to rearrange layout of the elements. Our team
              still try our best to make the website standout from the other
              similar existed website and suitable for many user objects.
